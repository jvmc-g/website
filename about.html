<p> I am currently a 5th Year Student in Ireland. (11th Grade) My main interests are programming, cars, computers, and technology. I also enjoy hobbies such as reading, riding my dirt bike, going for runs, mountain biking, etc. - Although I haven't decided on anything yet, In the future I would love to study in a tech-related field. Thank you.
